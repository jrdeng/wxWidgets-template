February 08, 2023 -- The wxWidgets team is pleased to announce a new
stable release of our open source framework for the development of native
cross-platform applications in C++.

wxWidgets 3.2.2 is part of the API and ABI-stable 3.2.x release series and is
now available from

    https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/

and

    https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/v3.2.2

This release comes only a few months after the previous 3.2.1, but contains
an important number of bug fixes and enhancements, further improving high DPI
support, including:

- Better window resizing on DPI change in wxMSW.
- Fix using native icons returned by wxArtProvider.
- Fix menu items using custom font in high DPI.
- High resolution icons support in wxGenericTreeCtrl and wxGenericListCtrl.

and also improving locale-related code under Mac and Unix systems:

- wxUILocale::UseDefault() works for locales using different language and
  region under Mac and fails when used for unsupported locale under Unix.
- New wxUILocale::GetSystemLocaleId() allows to retrieve such locales IDs.
- wxUILocale::GetCurrent() works currently for "C" locale under Mac.

Some other user-visible enhancements made in this release:

- Allow selecting and copying text in wxMessageDialog in wxGTK.
- Improve size and behaviour of in-place editor in wxGenericTreeCtrl.
- Fix sometimes missing overwrite prompt in "Save" file dialog in wxMSW.
- Fix glitch in drawing wxStaticBox with a control as label in wxMSW.

There are also some important bug fixes:

- Fix regression in saving TIFF images that could end up truncated.
- Fix long standing bug in parsing wxHTTP responses.
- Fix data race when processing events generated in a worker thread.
- Avoid appending extraneous NUL bytes to wxTextDataObject text in wxMSW.
- Fix handling of fonts with fractional sizes in wxOSX.
- Fix resizing wxGLCanvas with EGL and Wayland in wxGTK.
- Fix display artefacts when using AUI without compositor under X11.
- Work around crashes when using wxTextCtrl with MinGW TDM 64.
- Fix for a possible crash when handling menu events under Mac.
- Third-party libraries have been updated to the latest versions.

All in all, this release includes ~150 fixes from 27 unique contributors,
please see the full change log for more details:

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.

We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!
